Cocos2d-html5 (BlueCanoe Fork)
==================

Fork of [Cocos2d-html5](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-html5). 
Making a few changes and cherry picking pull requests to suit our games.

Build
-------------

Much easier to build than the original repo. 
* Install [apache ant](http://ant.apache.org/) 
* Run `ant -f tools/build.xml` 
* Alternatively, open in VSCode and run the build task (Cmd+B by default)
